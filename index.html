    <h2>About Me</h2>
     


<p>	I have always been passionate about knowledge organization, preservation, and accessibility. My academic journey has equipped 
	me with a strong foundation in library management and information services, having earned both a Diploma and Bachelor of Library and Information Studies 
	acquired from the Natinal University of Lesotho. During my studies, I gained valuable hands-on experience through experiential learning at 
	Mangoaela Library and ICT in Lesotho College of Education, where I was attached for practical training. 
	This opportunity deepened my understanding of how libraries and archives operate while strengthening 
	my skills in managing information resources effectively.</p>


<p>	Beyond traditional library services, I have cultivated a strong interest in digital literacy and website development, 
	particularly as tools for improving information access. This gave me understanding that by integrating technology into 
	information management, the gaps in access can be easiy bridged and more nclusive digital spaces can be created for learning and research. My passion for 
	advancing professional growth in the field led me to conduct research on 
	training and professional development programs for librarians. I explored how these programs enhance librarians' skills and improve their ability 
	to meet the evolving needs of library users. This research allowed me to critically assess the effectiveness of existing training 
	initiatives and propose recommendations for improvement, ensuring that librarians are equipped to navigate the dynamic information landscape.</p>
	
	
<p>	Moreover, I also conducted case study on special groups at the State Library of Lesotho, where I explored how national and public 
	libraries serve marginalized communities. This research aimed to identify areas for improvement in library services to ensure they better 
	meet the needs of diverse user populations. Through this study, I contributed to the ongoing conversation on accessibility and inclusivity in 
	library services.</p>


<p>	Furthermore, I worked at Morija Museum and Archives as Assistant Archivist after acquiring my Diploma, where I was responsible for sorting and filing
	archival materials, preparing them for digitization, and ultimately digitizing them. This project played a vital role in preserving historical 
	records and enhancing their accessibility for researchers and the public. Through this experience, I developed expertise in digital archiving, 
	metadata creation, and handling delicate archival materials with care.</p>

	<h3>Project 1: Experiential learning at Lesotho College of Education</h3>

<p>		During my experiential learning I was doing automation which is the process of using technology, sofware or mechines to
		perform library process that include cataloguing or acquisition without human intervention, 
		in the purpose of making access and retrieval easy. 
		In this activity i was entering bibliographic details of every material to the library system and also allocating barcodes. 
		First day of performing automation, I automated three books and edited four books, but later on as I gained more experience 
		I was able to automate ten to eighteen books.</p> 

	<p>	Another important activity was digitizing important and rear materials in the Institutional Repository and Archives where I was scanning important, 
		fragile and rare library materials using a scanner and adding them to the IR stocktaking database. I was scanning documents, such as reports, 
		graduation ceremony speeches, thesis and dissertations, calendars, policies, 
		minutes, passed question papers and other rare library materials. I was able to scan and add to the database 10 copies per day.</p></article>

<h3> Project 2: Case study at State Library of Lesotho</h3>

<figure>
 	<p>Libraries are essential spaces for learning, exploration, and access to information, but not everyone can interact with them in the same way. 
		Throughout my project, I focused on understanding how the State Library serves people with visual disabilities, children and young adults, 
		and elderly individuals, and what can be done to improve their experiences. While libraries aim to be inclusive, 
		certain groups still face barriers to access, and my goal was to identify these challenges and propose meaningful solutions.</p>
		
		<p>Each user group has unique needs that require specific accommodations. People with visual disabilities depend on resources such as Braille books, 
		audiobooks, and screen reader technology, but these materials are often limited. Children and young adults require engaging spaces, 
		accessible educational content, and interactive learning tools to encourage literacy and curiosity. 
		Elderly users may struggle with small print sizes, difficulty navigating library systems, or a lack of support for lifelong learning.</p>

		<p>Librarians face significant challenges in assisting these groups, such as a lack of specialized training, limited funding, 
		and low awareness of available services. Many individuals who could benefit from these resources do not even know they exist, 
		making it difficult for libraries to reach their intended audiences.</p>

	<p>     Based on my research, I identified several ways to improve accessibility for these special user groups:<br>
	1.	Librarians should receive specialized training in assistive technologies, inclusive library services, 
		and techniques to better support diverse users.<br>
	2.	State Library should promote their accessibility services through outreach efforts, 
		community events, and partnerships with schools and disability support organizations.<br> 
	3.	State Library need more Braille books, audiobooks, large-print materials, 
		and interactive educational resources to ensure all users have access to content suited to their needs.</p></article>

  	<h3>Project 3: Digitization project at Morija Museum and Archives</h3>

  <figcaption>Figure 3: The process of preparing archival materials for digitization.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>At Morija Museum and Archives, I was deeply involved in this digitization project, ensuring that valuable documents were carefully handled and 
	converted into digital formats for future use.The first steps I was involved in were sorting and filing archival materials. 
	This required organizing documents based on their historical significance, condition, and classification, 
	ensuring they were properly cataloged before the digitization process began. 
	Attention to detail was essential in maintaining the integrity of these records. 
	The digitization itself involved scanning or photographing documents using high-resolution equipment, such as cameras, scanners and software for storage,
	converting them into digital formats while preserving their original quality.</p>
